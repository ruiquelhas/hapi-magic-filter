# hapi-magic-filter

Hapi.js plugin to validate multipart/form-data file contents.


## How to use

As usual, you will need to install the package first.

```bash
$ npm install hapi-magic-filter
```

Since this is an [hapi.js](http://hapijs.com/) plugin, you need to use it like so. There are just three things you have need to remember. If you want to use the default file format [whitelist](#whitelist), just register the plugin.

```javascript
var Hapi = require('hapi');
var magic = require('hapi-magic-filter');

var server = Hapi.createServer(1337);
server.pack.register([
  magic,
  // Any other plugins you want to register
], function (err) {
  server.start(function () {
    // whatevs
  });
});
```

If you feel safer using only a subset of the formats available in the default whitelist, you can just provide the list file extensions you are ok with. Let's assume you are just interested in `PNG` or `JPEG` files. You'll need to register the plugin with additional options, providing that information via an array on the `allowed` field.

```javascript
var Hapi = require('hapi');
var magic = require('hapi-magic-filter');

var server = Hapi.createServer(1337);
server.pack.register([
  {
    plugin: magic,
    options: {
      allowed: ['png', 'jpg']
    }
  }
  // Any other plugins you want to register
  ], function (err) {
  server.start(function () {
    // whatevs
  });
});
```

<a name="hipster">If you are felling hipster, you can just provide your own custom whitelist (which will override the default one), using an object whose keys match the file extensions and values match the magic numbers.</a>

```javascript
var Hapi = require('hapi');
var magic = require('hapi-magic-filter');

var server = Hapi.createServer(1337);
server.pack.register([
  {
    plugin: magic,
    options: {
      allowed: {
        'png': '8950',
        'jpg': 'ffd8'
      }
    }
  }
  // Any other plugins you want to register
  ], function (err) {
  server.start(function () {
    // whatevs
  });
});
```

In any case, this is just glue on the `onPreHandler` extension point, so if all the uploaded file types are whitelisted, the plugin will just return control to your application, otherwise it will reply with a proper `HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type` error.

## <a name="whitelist">Default file format whitelist</a>

By default, you get the following whitelist of file formats:

* `bz2`
* `jpg`
* `mp4`
* `ogg`
* `pdf`
* `png`
* `tar`

These are probably the most used interchangeable file formats on the web, but if you think you need more, by now, you should know how to provide your [own](#hipster) whitelist. However, if you think those additional file formats you need, should be an integral part of the base implementation, just open an [issue](//github.com/ruiquelhas/hapi-magic-filter/issues/new) or submit a [pull request](//github.com/ruiquelhas/hapi-magic-filter/compare/).
